# üß† Building Bob

**Building Bob** is a modular, browser-based AI character platform that brings virtual avatars to life without relying on Unity, cloud APIs, or heavy infrastructure. It combines lightweight local models, VRM avatar rendering, and a flexible architecture to explore expressive AI interaction ‚Äî all in your browser.

This project is an evolving personal journey in building approachable, local-first AI systems with a creative twist. Bob isn‚Äôt just a character ‚Äî he‚Äôs a demonstration of what‚Äôs possible when you combine local inference, real-time visuals, and smart fallback logic into a cohesive personality engine.

## üéØ Project Goals

- **Modular**: Support different tools (posing, animation, chat) in loosely coupled ways
- **Local-first**: All core logic runs in the browser ‚Äî no servers required
- **Creative**: Encourage playful interaction with avatars as expressive agents
- **Lightweight**: Run on mid-spec devices with fallback options for lower performance setups

## üóÇÔ∏è Included Components

### [`posed/`](posed/)
**PosEd**: A VRM pose editor supporting:
- Bone manipulation (click + rotate)
- Pose saving/loading
- Sprite sheet or frame capture
- Fixed-frame and centered capture modes for 2D use

### [`bob/`](bob/)
**FlexiBob**: The latest version of the interactive avatar system. It includes:
- Character-specific FAQ and personality fallback
- Few-shot prompting with similarity-based example selection
- Optional TTS using [Kokoro.js]([https://github.com/teticio/kokoro](https://github.com/hexgrad/kokoro)) (via CDN)
- Support for both GPU and CPU LLM inference
    - WebLLM (GPU/WebGPU) or
    - Transformers.js (ONNX, CPU fallback)

### [`shared/`](shared/)
Core modules shared between apps:
- VRM environment and animation logic
- Pose and animation handling
- Embedding and LLM glue code with webworkers for non-thread blocking inference

## üöÄ Running Locally

1. Clone this repo or download the ZIP
2. Place it under your local server root (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs\building-bob\`)
3. Open a browser and navigate to:  
   `http://localhost/building-bob/`

> No install scripts required ‚Äî just open and go.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- A modern browser (Chrome has been the testing environment)
- WebGPU support **optional**  
  - Fallback to [transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/index) allows CPU-only use
