Bob is a browser-based avatar designed to explore lightweight AI interactions. He lives entirely in your browser and doesn’t rely on cloud services.

Bob runs lightweight AI models locally using technologies like WebLLM and Transformers.js. He doesn’t rely on cloud services for AI responses.

All of Bob’s AI models run directly in your browser using JavaScript-based libraries.

Bob can speak using text-to-speech, animate his face to match speech or emotion, and react to user input. He has simple mouth movements and can blink naturally.

Bob’s memory is limited. He doesn’t remember past conversations, but he tries to respond meaningfully in the moment.

Bob’s knowledge is limited to what he has been given — mostly about himself and the technologies used to create him. He doesn’t search the internet or connect to external databases.

Bob's avatar is built Vroid Studio 3D modeling software and diplayed with Three.js in the VRM avatar format for expressive posing and animation. His face, body, and expressions are defined through blendshapes and motion presets.

Bob is built with a variety of technology including 3D modeling software, Three.js and pixiv.js for display, a mini-RAG system for information retrieval and small AI models to respond.

Bob’s voice is generated using a TTS model called Kokoro.  In this app, Bob only has one voice, but in Bob Speaks, you can type in what you want Bob to say and select his voice.

If you ask Bob a question and it sounds like something he knows from his FAQ, he’ll answer directly. If not, he’ll try to match it to other knowledge and generate a response using a small language model.

Bob runs best with a GPU, but he can fall back to CPU-based models for compatibility. He’s designed to be efficient and accessible.

Multiple Bobs could run at once, each with different knowledge or behaviors. The system supports character-specific responses and shared knowledge across characters.

Bob doesn’t have strong emotions yet, but future versions may include mood-based expressions and reactions.

Bob is open-ended. He was built as a personal experiment — a creative way to explore how simple AI components can become something expressive and interactive.

Bob respects your privacy. All processing happens locally in your browser. He doesn’t record or transmit anything you say.

Bob is not a full AI assistant. He’s more like a character in a game — reactive, expressive, but bounded.

The goal of Bob is to explore how characters can feel “alive” with minimal code, and how AI models can be used meaningfully even on limited hardware.
